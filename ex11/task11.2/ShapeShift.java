/* This program performs simple calculations and manipulations of 
   simple shapes expressed in two dimensionl coordinate geometry.

   First it asks the user to choos a shape, from a choice of three.
   Then it prompts details of the shape.
   * A circle is specified by giving the X and the Y coordinate
    of its centre, followed by its radius.
   * A triangle is specified by giving the X and Y coordinates
    of each of its three corner points.
   * A rectangle is specified by giving the X and Y coordinates
    of two of its diagonally opposite corner points.

   Following this data, the user is prompted to specify an X offset
   and a Y offset.

   The program creates the specified shape, and also a similar one, 
   in which each point has been shifted by the X and Y offsets.

   The program then reports the following on the standard output.
   * The details of the original shape -- giving all the points
    (one, three, or four) and, for a circle, its radius
   * The area and perimiter of the shape
   * The details of the shifted shape.
